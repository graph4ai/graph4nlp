# Graph4NLP

***Graph4NLP*** is an easy-to-use library for R&D at the intersection of **Deep Learning on Graphs** and
**Natural Language Processing** (i.e., DLG4NLP). It provides both **full implementations** of state-of-the-art models for data scientists and also **flexible interfaces** to build customized models for researchers and developers with whole-pipeline support. Built upon highly-optimized runtime libraries including [DGL](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl) , ***Graph4NLP*** has both high running efficiency and great extensibility. The architecture of ***Graph4NLP*** is shown in the following figure, where boxes with dashed lines represents the features under development. Graph4NLP consists of four different layers: 1) Data Layer, 2) Module Layer, 3) Model Layer, and 4) Application Layer.

**06/05/2021:** The **v0.4.1 release**. Try it out!

## Quick tour

***Graph4nlp*** aims to make it incredibly easy to use GNNs in NLP tasks (check out [Graph4NLP Documentation](http://saizhuo.wang/g4nlp/index.html)). Here is an example of how to use the [*Graph2seq*](http://saizhuo.wang/g4nlp/index.html) model (widely used in machine translation, question answering,
semantic parsing, and various other NLP tasks that can be abstracted as graph-to-sequence problem and has shown superior
performance).

<!-- If you want to further improve model performance, we also support pre-trained models including [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), etc.
 -->
We also offer other high-level model APIs such as graph-to-tree models. If you are interested in DLG4NLP related research problems, you are very welcome to use our library and refer to our [graph4nlp survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06090).

```python
from graph4nlp.pytorch.datasets.jobs import JobsDataset
from graph4nlp.pytorch.modules.graph_construction.dependency_graph_construction import DependencyBasedGraphConstruction
from graph4nlp.pytorch.modules.config import get_basic_args
from graph4nlp.pytorch.models.graph2seq import Graph2Seq
from graph4nlp.pytorch.modules.utils.config_utils import update_values, get_yaml_config

# build dataset
jobs_dataset = JobsDataset(root_dir='graph4nlp/pytorch/test/dataset/jobs',
                           topology_builder=DependencyBasedGraphConstruction,
                           topology_subdir='DependencyGraph')  # You should run stanfordcorenlp at background
vocab_model = jobs_dataset.vocab_model

# build model
user_args = get_yaml_config("examples/pytorch/semantic_parsing/graph2seq/config/dependency_gcn_bi_sep_demo.yaml")
args = get_basic_args(graph_construction_name="node_emb", graph_embedding_name="gat", decoder_name="stdrnn")
update_values(to_args=args, from_args_list=[user_args])
graph2seq = Graph2Seq.from_args(args, vocab_model)

# calculation
batch_data = JobsDataset.collate_fn(jobs_dataset.train[0:12])

scores = graph2seq(batch_data["graph_data"], batch_data["tgt_seq"])  # [Batch_size, seq_len, Vocab_size]
```

## Graph4NLP Models and Applications

### Graph4NLP models

- [Graph2Seq](https://github.com/graph4ai/graph4nlp/blob/master/graph4nlp/pytorch/models/graph2seq.py): a general end-to-end neural encoder-decoder model that maps an input graph to a sequence of tokens.  
- [Graph2Tree](https://github.com/graph4ai/graph4nlp/blob/master/graph4nlp/pytorch/models/graph2tree.py): a general end-to-end neural encoder-decoder model that maps an input graph to a tree structure.

### Graph4NLP applications

We provide a comprehensive collection of NLP applications, together with detailed examples as follows:

- [Text classification](https://github.com/graph4ai/graph4nlp/tree/master/examples/pytorch/text_classification): to give the sentence or document an appropriate label.
- [Semantic parsing](https://github.com/graph4ai/graph4nlp/tree/master/examples/pytorch/semantic_parsing): to translate natural language into a machine-interpretable formal meaning representation.
- [Neural machine translation](https://github.com/graph4ai/graph4nlp/tree/master/examples/pytorch/nmt): to translate a sentence in a source language to a different target language.
- [summarization](https://github.com/graph4ai/graph4nlp/tree/master/examples/pytorch/summarization): to generate a shorter version of input texts which could preserve major meaning.
- [KG completion](https://github.com/graph4ai/graph4nlp/tree/master/examples/pytorch/kg_completion): to predict missing relations between two existing entities in konwledge graphs.
- [Math word problem solving](https://github.com/graph4ai/graph4nlp/tree/master/examples/pytorch/math_word_problem): to automatically solve mathematical exercises that provide background information about a problem in easy-to-understand language.
- [Name entity recognition](https://github.com/graph4ai/graph4nlp/tree/master/examples/pytorch/name_entity_recognition): to tag entities in input texts with their corresponding type.
- [Question generation](https://github.com/graph4ai/graph4nlp/tree/master/examples/pytorch/question_generation): to generate an valid and fluent question based on the given passage and target answer (optional).

## Installation

Currently, users can install Graph4NLP via **pip** or **source code**. Graph4NLP supports the following OSes:

- Linux-based systems (tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and later)
- macOS (only CPU version)
- Windows 10 (only support pytorch >= 1.8)

### Installation via pip (binaries)
We provide pip wheels for all major OS/PyTorch/CUDA combinations. Note that we highly recommend `Windows` users refer to `Installation via source code` due to compatibility.

#### Ensure that at least PyTorch (>=1.6.0) is installed:
Note that `>=1.6.0` is ok.
``` bash
$ python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
>>> 1.6.0
```
#### Find the CUDA version PyTorch was installed with (for GPU users):
```bash
$ python -c "import torch; print(torch.version.cuda)"
>>> 10.2
```

#### Install the relevant dependencies:
`torchtext` is needed since Graph4NLP relies on it to implement embeddings.
Please pay attention to the PyTorch requirements before installing `torchtext` with the following script! For detailed version matching please refer [here](https://pypi.org/project/torchtext/).
``` bash
pip install torchtext # >=0.7.0
```


#### Install Graph4NLP
```bash
pip install graph4nlp${CUDA}
```
where `${CUDA}` should be replaced by the specific CUDA version (`none` (CPU version), `"-cu92"`, `"-cu101"`, `"-cu102"`, `"-cu110"`). The following table shows the concrete command lines. For CUDA 11.1 users, please refer to `Installation via source code`.

| Platform  | Command                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------- |
| CPU       | `pip install graph4nlp`   |
| CUDA 9.2  | `pip install graph4nlp-cu92`  |
| CUDA 10.1 | `pip install graph4nlp-cu101` |
| CUDA 10.2 | `pip install graph4nlp-cu102` |
| CUDA 11.0 | `pip install graph4nlp-cu110` |

### Installation via source code

#### Ensure that at least PyTorch (>=1.6.0) is installed:
Note that `>=1.6.0` is ok.
``` bash
$ python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
>>> 1.6.0
```
#### Find the CUDA version PyTorch was installed with (for GPU users):
```bash
$ python -c "import torch; print(torch.version.cuda)"
>>> 10.2
```

#### Install the relevant dependencies:
`torchtext` is needed since Graph4NLP relies on it to implement embeddings.
Please pay attention to the PyTorch requirements before installing `torchtext` with the following script! For detailed version matching please refer [here](https://pypi.org/project/torchtext/).
``` bash
pip install torchtext # >=0.7.0
```

#### Download the source code of `Graph4NLP` from Github:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/graph4ai/graph4nlp.git
cd graph4nlp
```
#### Configure the CUDA version
Then run `./configure` (or `./configure.bat`  if you are using Windows 10) to config your installation. The configuration program will ask you to specify your CUDA version. If you do not have a GPU, please type 'cpu'.
```bash
./configure
```

#### Install the relevant packages:

Finally, install the package:

```shell
python setup.py install
```
